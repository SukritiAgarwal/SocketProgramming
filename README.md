CECS 327 Intro to Networking and Distributed System
Socket Programming (100 points) 

Requirements: You are required to write an Echo Client and an Echo Server 
program. The echo client communicates with the echo server using UDP. The 
programs should fulfill the following requirements: 

Client: 
1. Prompts the user for a line of input. 
2. Sends the line to the server. 
3. Displays whatever the server sends back. 
4. Displays an error message if the arguments in the command line are not 
valid. 

Server 
1. Receives the data from the client. 
2. Echoes it back to the client. 
Note: 1. Java language should be used. 
2. Do NOT hard code the server address and port number in your source code. 
The server address and port number should be set as command line 
arguments. 
3. Your program should work under MS-DOS window.
